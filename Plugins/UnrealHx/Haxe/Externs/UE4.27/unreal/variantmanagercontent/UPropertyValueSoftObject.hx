/**
  Stores data from a USoftObjectProperty.
  It will store it's recorded data as a raw UObject*, and use the usual UPropertyValue
  facilities for serializing it as a Soft object ptr. This derived class handles converting
  to and from the property's underlying FSoftObjectPtr to our UObject*.
  We can't keep a FSoftObjectPtr ourselves, neither as a temp member nor as raw bytes, as it has
  internal heap-allocated data members like FName and FString.
