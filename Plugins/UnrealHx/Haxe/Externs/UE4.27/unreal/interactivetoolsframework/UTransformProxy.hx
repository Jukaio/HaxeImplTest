/**
  UTransformProxy is used to transform a set of sub-ojects. An internal
  FTransform is generated based on the sub-object set, and the relative
  FTransform of each sub-object is stored. Then as this main transform
  is updated, the sub-objects are also updated.
  
  Currently only USceneComponent sub-objects are supported.
  
  If only one sub-object is set, the main transform is the sub-object transform.
  Otherwise the main transform is centered at the average origin and
  has no rotation.
