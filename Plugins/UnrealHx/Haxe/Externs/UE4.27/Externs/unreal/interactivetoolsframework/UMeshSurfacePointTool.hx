/**
  UMeshSurfacePointTool is a base Tool implementation that can be used to implement various
  "point on surface" interactions. The tool acts on an input IMeshDescriptionSource object,
  which the standard Builder can extract from the current selection (eg Editor selection).
  
  Subclasses override the OnBeginDrag/OnUpdateDrag/OnEndDrag and OnUpdateHover functions
  to implement custom behavior.
