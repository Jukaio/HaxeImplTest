  ULocalClickDragInputBehavior is an implementation of UClickDragInputBehavior that also implements IClickDragBehaviorTarget directly,
  via a set of local lambda functions. To use/customize this class the client replaces the lambda functions with their own.
  This avoids having to create a second IClickDragBehaviorTarget implementation for trivial use-cases.
