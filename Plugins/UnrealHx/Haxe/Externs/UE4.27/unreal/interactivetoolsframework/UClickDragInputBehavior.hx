  UClickDragInputBehavior implements a standard "button-click-drag"-style input behavior.
  An IClickDragBehaviorTarget instance must be provided which is manipulated by this behavior.
  
  The state machine works as follows:
     1) on input-device-button-press, call Target::CanBeginClickDragSequence to determine if capture should begin
     2) on input-device-move, call Target::OnClickDrag
     3) on input-device-button-release, call Target::OnClickRelease
  
  If a ForceEndCapture occurs we call Target::OnTerminateDragSequence
