  UAudioAnalyzerNRT
  
  UAudioAnalyzerNRT applies an analyzer to a sound using specific settings, stores the
  results and exposes them via blueprints.
  
  Subclasses of UAudioAnalyzerNRT must implement GetAnalyzerNRTFactoryName() to associate
  the UAudioAnalyzerNRT with an IAudioAnalyzerNRTFactory implementation.
  
  To support blueprint access, subclasses can implement UFUNCTIONs to expose the data
  returned by GetResult().
