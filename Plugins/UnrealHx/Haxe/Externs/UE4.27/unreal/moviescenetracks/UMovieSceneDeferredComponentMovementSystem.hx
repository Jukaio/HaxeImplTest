/**
  WARNING: This type was defined as MinimalAPI on its declaration. Because of that, its properties/methods are inaccessible
  
  System that maintains a FScopedMovementUpdate for any USceneComponent that has an
  animated transform or attachment for the duration of the evaluation to avoid repeatedly
  updating child transforms and/or overlaps.
  
  This system can be enabled/disabled using the cvar Sequencer.DeferMovementUpdates (is disabled by default)
  Output logging options are controlled by Sequencer.OutputDeferredMovementMode which is useful for tracking
  how many components are being moved in any given frame.
  
  This system runs in the Initialization and Evaluaion phases:
      Initialization: Gathers and initializes deferred movement for any AttachParent components that need (un)link
      Evaluation: Gathers and initializes deferred movement for any Component Transforms; queues up an event trigger to be executed at the end of the phase
      Finalization: Applys all pending movement updates in reverse order
