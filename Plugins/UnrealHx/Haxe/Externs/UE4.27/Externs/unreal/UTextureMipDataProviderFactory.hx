  UTextureMipDataProviderFactory defines an interface to create instances of FTextureMipDataProvider.
  Derived classes from UTextureMipDataProviderFactory can be attached to UTexture::MipDataProviderFactory
  to define a new source for mip content (instead of the default disk file or ddc mips).
  Usecases include dynamic textures that need to be driven by the texture streaming or textures that
  get they data over the network.
