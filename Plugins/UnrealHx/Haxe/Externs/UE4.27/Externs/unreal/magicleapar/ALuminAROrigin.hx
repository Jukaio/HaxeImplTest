/**
  WARNING: This type was not defined as DLL export on its declaration. Because of that, some of its methods are inaccessible
  
  Because of the way ARPlanesTracker works, assuming the current ARSession
          configuration contains the flag 'bGenerateMeshDataFromTrackedGeometry',
          the ARPlanesTracker requires that there exists a UMaterialInterface
          which is compatible with the mesh data provided to UMRMeshComponents
          which are subsequently attached to the AROrigin.  This is because for
          some reason, the default surface material obtained via
          UMaterial::GetDefaultMaterial(MD_Surface) does not correctly render
          vertex data provided to the UMRMeshComponents, even if an exact copy
          of the WorldGridMaterial itself does!
  For this reason, the LuminAROrigin will store a compatible material which
          is loaded via standard UE4 constructor interfaces.
