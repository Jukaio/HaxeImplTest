  ULoudnessNRT
  
  ULoudnessNRT calculates the temporal evolution of perceptual loudness for a given
  sound. Loudness is available for individual channels or the overall sound asset. Normalized
  loudness values convert the range to 0.0 to 1.0 where 0.0 is the noise floor and 1.0 is the
  maximum loudness of the particular sound.
