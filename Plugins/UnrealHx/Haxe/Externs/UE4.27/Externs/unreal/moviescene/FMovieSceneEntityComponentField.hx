  High-level container which acts as a look-up-table for IMovieSceneEntityProviders and their entities and meta-data in a sequence
  
  Generally generated and accessed through UMovieSceneCompiledDataManager, but can also be used independently.
  Entity fields are constructed using FMovieSceneEntityComponentFieldBuilder which ensures the invariants of this class are
  maintained along with guaranteeing no redundant entries exist.
