/**
  UAnyButtonInputBehavior is a base behavior that provides a generic
  interface to a TargetButton on a physical Input Device. You can subclass
  UAnyButtonInputBehavior to write InputBehaviors that can work independent
  of a particular device type or button, by using the UAnyButtonInputBehavior functions below.
  
  The target device button is selected using the .ButtonNumber property, or you can
  override the relevant GetXButtonState() function if you need more control.
  
   @todo spatial controllers
   @todo support tablet fingers
   @todo support gamepad?
