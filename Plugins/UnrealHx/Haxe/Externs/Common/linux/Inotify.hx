       IN_CLOEXEC  Set the close-on-exec (FD_CLOEXEC) flag on the new file
                   descriptor.  See the description of the O_CLOEXEC flag in
                   open(2) for reasons why this may be useful.

  /**
    inotify_add_watch() adds a new watch, or modifies an existing watch,
    for the file whose location is specified in pathname; the caller must
    have read permission for this file.  The fd argument is a file
    descriptor referring to the inotify instance whose watch list is to
    be modified.  The events to be monitored for pathname are specified
    in the mask bit-mask argument.  See inotify(7) for a description of
    the bits that can be set in mask.

    A successful call to inotify_add_watch() returns a unique watch
    descriptor for this inotify instance, for the filesystem object
    (inode) that corresponds to pathname.  If the filesystem object was
    not previously being watched by this inotify instance, then the watch
    descriptor is newly allocated.  If the filesystem object was already
    being watched (perhaps via a different link to the same object), then
    the descriptor for the existing watch is returned.

    The watch descriptor is returned by later read(2)s from the inotify
    file descriptor.  These reads fetch inotify_event structures (see
    inotify(7)) indicating filesystem events; the watch descriptor inside
    this structure identifies the object for which the event occurred.

    RETURN VALUE

    On success, inotify_add_watch() returns a nonnegative watch
    descriptor.  On error, -1 is returned and errno is set appropriately.

    ERRORS

    EACCES Read access to the given file is not permitted.

    EBADF  The given file descriptor is not valid.

    EFAULT pathname points outside of the process's accessible address
    space.

    EINVAL The given event mask contains no valid events; or mask
    contains both IN_MASK_ADD and IN_MASK_CREATE; or fd is not an
    inotify file descriptor.
    ENAMETOOLONG
    pathname is too long.

    ENOENT A directory component in pathname does not exist or is a
    dangling symbolic link.

    ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.

    ENOSPC The user limit on the total number of inotify watches was
    reached or the kernel failed to allocate a needed resource.

    ENOTDIR
    mask contains IN_ONLYDIR and pathname is not a directory.

    EEXIST mask contains IN_MASK_CREATE and pathname refers to a file
    already being watched by the same fd.
