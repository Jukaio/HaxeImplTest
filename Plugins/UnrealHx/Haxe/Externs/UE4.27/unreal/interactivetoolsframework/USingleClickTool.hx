/**
  USingleClickTool is perhaps the simplest possible interactive tool. It simply
  reacts to default primary button clicks for the active device (eg left-mouse clicks).
  
  The function ::IsHitByClick() determines what is clickable by this Tool. The default is
  to return true, which means the click will activate anywhere (the Tool itself has no
  notion of Actors, Components, etc). You can override this function to, for example,
  filter out clicks that don't hit a target object, etc.
  
  The function ::OnClicked() implements the action that will occur when a click happens.
  You must override this to implement any kind of useful behavior.
